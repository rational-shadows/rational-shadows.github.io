## Algorithm! So much fun!

Hello everybody! We are rational_shadows, a pair of CS student who **love** algorithms, coding
and especially waste their life on computer science problems.

Here you will find some solution to competitions or problems we have faced. We will provide
also some running `code` (mostly C++) for each of the solved challenges. However,
that code will NOT be beautiful and above all will not follow any good coding convention
(lots of global variables and maybe some goto here and there ;) ).  

So be advised and good surfing!
