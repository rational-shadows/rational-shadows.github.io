## Algorithms! So much fun!

Hello everybody! We are rational_shadows, a couple of CS student who **love** algorithms, coding
and especially waste their life on computer science problems.

Here you'll find some of our solutions to competitions or problems we've taken on. We'll also provide some running `code` (mostly C++) for each of the solved challenges. However,
that code will NOT be beautiful and above all it will not follow any good coding convention
(lots of global variables and maybe some goto here and there ;) ).  

So consider yourself warned, and good surfing!
